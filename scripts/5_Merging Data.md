### Merge the Data

Collect the raw data from your groupmates, and add them to your data/raw folder.

  1. Process them, too.  In the first `pd.read_csv()` step, read all the raw files and merge them into a single dataframe.
  2. Make sure the dataframe has columns that show where its data came from, and which trial number was run.
  3. Make sure the filename in data/processed reflects that it contains multiple people's data.
  4. Re-run the rest of the analysis, updating the code to account for the new changes.  Did your results change?
